A powerful and efficient library to interact with
`Facebook's Messenger <https://www.facebook.com/messages/>`__, using just your email and password.

This is *not* an official API, Facebook has that `over here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform>`__ for chat bots. This library differs by using a normal Facebook account instead.

``fbchat`` currently support:

- Sending many types of messages, with files, stickers, mentions, etc.
- Fetching all messages, threads and images in threads.
- Searching for messages and threads.
- Creating groups, setting the group emoji, changing nicknames, creating polls, etc.
- Listening for, an reacting to messages and other events in real-time.
- Type hints, and it has a modern codebase (e.g. only Python 3.5 and upwards).
- ``async``/``await`` (COMING).

Essentially, everything you need to make an amazing Facebook bot!


Version Warning
---------------
``v2`` is currently being developed at the ``master`` branch and it's highly unstable. If you want to view the old ``v1``, go `here <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/tree/v1>`__.

Additionally, you can view the project's progress `here <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/projects/2>`__.


Caveats
-------

``fbchat`` works by imitating what the browser does, and thereby tricking Facebook into thinking it's accessing the website normally.

However, there's a catch! **Using this library may not comply with Facebook's Terms Of Service!**, so be responsible Facebook citizens! We are not responsible if your account gets banned!

Additionally, **the APIs the library is calling is undocumented!** In theory, this means that your code could break tomorrow, without the slightest warning!
If this happens to you, please report it, so that we can fix it as soon as possible!
