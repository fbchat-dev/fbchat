fbchat is developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

      # optionally, zipball is also available (for Windows users).

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily::
