Facebook Chat (`Messenger <https://www.facebook.com/messages/>`_) for Python.
This project was inspired by `facebook-chat-api <https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api>`_.

**No XMPP or API key is needed**. Just use your email and password.

Currently `fbchat` support Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6:

`fbchat` works by emulating the browser.
This means doing the exact same GET/POST requests and tricking Facebook into thinking it's accessing the website normally.
Therefore, this API requires the credentials of a Facebook account.

.. note::
    If you're having problems, please check the :ref:`faq`, before asking questions on Github

.. warning::
    We are not responsible if your account gets banned for spammy activities,
    such as sending lots of messages to people you don't know, sending messages very quickly,
    sending spammy looking URLs, logging in and out very quickly... Be responsible Facebook citizens.

.. note::
    Facebook now has an `official API <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform>`_ for chat bots,
    so if you're familiar with node.js, this might be what you're looking for.

If you're already familiar with the basics of how Facebook works internally, go to :ref:`examples` to see example usage of `fbchat`
